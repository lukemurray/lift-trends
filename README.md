Simple application to compare and find relationships between your Lift.do habits.

Because Lift.do doesn't have an API (yet?) you have to export your habits from Settings in Lift.do. You can then upload that file to this application and start comparing your habits.

Your habits are not kept; the file is parsed on the server and some formatted JSON returned to the client. Check the source out for yourself. Or clone it and run it yourself if you don't trust me.
